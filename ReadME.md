# Counter App Front End Challenge

## Description

The app includes:

- A counter that increments or decrements the number with two buttons. Multiple users can interact with the counter simultaneously, and the value is updated with each user's click and is shared with all users.
- Another local counter that tracks how many times each user has clicked any of the two buttons.
- A Three.js scene with a rotating sphere and an input line for changing the radius of the sphere. The minimum radius is set to 1, and the maximum is set to 4. Similarly to the counter, all users interact with the sphere simultaneously, collectively changing its radius.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/dzimika/counter_app_sphere

2. Navigate to the backend folder and start the server
   cd backend
